This is a project which allows the user to draw a closed curve which is tranformed into a mesh
then smoothed dynamically

dependencies: tKinter, numpy, math, triangle, sys

to run: 
cd into the directory python_draw_mesh

type "make interior mesh" to generate a mesh within the interior of the closed curve

type "make exterior mesh" to generate a mesh outside the curve of the closed curve (not entirely working as of now)
